Overview
========

This package contains some modules to read and process the result files from
Dymola_ and OpenModelica_ with Python_. A script is included that will help you 
to browse and export the contents of these files to other formats.

Both simulation systems save their results in regular mat-files, but use a
special variable structure to store the data efficiently. An easy way to
access the data is MATLAB_, but some people (like me) don't have it or don't 
want to use it.

If you want to use this package in your own python scripts you should read the
section `Python API`_.

The documentation on the provided script DyMatExport is in the section
DyMatExport_.
